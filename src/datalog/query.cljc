(ns datalog.query
  "`[s p o]` triple-pattern query with wildcards (nil) over a `datalog.index`
  db, routing to whichever index matches the bound positions -- bound subject
  -> spo, bound predicate only -> pso, bound predicate + bound object -> pos,
  bound object only -> honest full scan, fully unbound -> full spo scan.

  This is a pure routing function over `datalog.index`'s four indices. It has
  no storage of its own and reads only the in-memory db it is handed.

  `query`'s `visible?` is REQUIRED: a query is not a bare read. This
  namespace stays auth-agnostic by design -- no purpose/scope/capability
  opinion lives here -- but it refuses to run a query without the caller
  stating a visibility decision, because there is no permissive default that
  is safe to fall back on silently. Pass `(constantly true)` to see
  everything; that is a caller's explicit choice, not this namespace's.
  `cardinality` carries the same requirement, for the same reason and by the
  same mechanism -- see its docstring."

(defn- query-seq
  "Matching quads as a SEQ, in index order, routed exactly as the ns docstring
  describes. `query` turns this into a set; `cardinality` counts it without
  ever building one.

  This used to build the set inline, so a caller that only wanted to know HOW
  MANY rows a pattern matches still paid to hash every quad into a set and then
  discarded it. That caller exists and is not rare: the query planner estimates
  every clause this way on every query
  (kotobase-peer.core/datalog-query-plan), and one such estimate -- 361,246
  rows for a both-ends-unbound `knows` clause -- measured as 38% of an LDBC
  IC09 query's total time (kotobase-peer
  bench/results/2026-08-02-scan-instrumentation.edn)."

  Same `visible?` contract as `query`: REQUIRED, and applied to every
  candidate, so a count can never report rows a read would not return. What is
  skipped is only the set -- no hashing, no membership checks, no retained
  collection.

  `query` returns a set, so in principle it could report fewer rows than this
  counts if a pattern could yield the same quad twice. None can: every branch
  of `query-seq` walks its index once and each quad appears at one position in
  it. The equivalence test asserts that rather than assuming it."

(defn estimate-cardinality
  "Cheap upper bound for how many quads `pattern` can match, derived directly
  from the covering indexes without constructing quads or invoking a
  visibility predicate.

  This is deliberately NOT `cardinality`: authorization may hide some of the
  indexed rows, so the result can be larger than a visible query's result.
  That makes it suitable for a query planner's cost hint (an overestimate can
  choose a less aggressive strategy but cannot expose a row or change an
  answer), while callers that need an exact visible count must continue to use
  `cardinality`.

  The common graph-planning cases are proportional to index groups rather than
  matching rows: predicate-only patterns sum the sizes of the predicate's
  subject buckets, and a fully unbound pattern sums the subject/attribute
  buckets. In particular, no `{:s :p :o}` maps are allocated and no set is
  built merely to learn a planning number."
