  "Conjunctive multi-clause Datalog join over `datalog.query`'s single
  triple-pattern router -- a Datomic-SHAPED (not Datomic-compatible)
  `:find`/`:where` surface. `datalog.query` on its own is single-`[s p o]`-
  pattern only, with no variable binding across clauses; this is the layer
  that binds, joins, recurses, negates, and aggregates.

  Extracted from `kotoba-lang/arrangement`'s `arrangement.datalog`, leaving
  arrangement's persistence half (commits, CIDs, prolly-tree snapshots)
  behind. Nothing here touches storage: a query runs against either an
  in-memory `datalog.index` db or anything satisfying
  `datom.source/IPatternSource` (see `scan*`), and that protocol is this
  library's only runtime dependency.

  A clause is `[e a v]` where each position is a bound value, a logic
  variable (a symbol whose name starts with `?`, e.g. `?x`), or the
  wildcard `_`. `q` binds variables left-to-right across `:where` clauses
  via nested-loop join (each clause's still-unbound variables become
  wildcards in the pattern handed to `datalog.query/query`; already-
  bound variables are substituted in as concrete values and re-checked
  against each candidate row), and projects the `:find` variables.

  ADR-2607061200 staged roadmap, Stage 2: negation (`(not [e a v])`
  clauses) and aggregation (`(count ?v)`/`(sum ?v)`/etc. in `:find`).
  Stage 3/4 (this landing): recursive rules -- Datomic-shaped `:rules`
  (`[[(rule-name ?a ?b) clause ...] ...]`, invoked from `:where` as
  `(rule-name ?x ?y)`), evaluated to a least fixpoint via semi-naive
  iteration. All three compose on top of the Stage 1 join without
  changing it, per the roadmap's own plan.

  **Negation and `visible?`** (security-relevant, not just a semantics
  choice): a `(not [e a v])` clause is evaluated through the exact same
  `visible?`-filtered `datalog.query/query` as every positive clause.
  A caller-redacted fact and a genuinely absent fact are therefore
  indistinguishable to `not` -- `visible?` is a first-class effect
  (ADR-2607050500), so a query must never be able to infer a hidden fact's
  *presence* by testing its *absence*. This is why negation is NOT
  implemented as \"run the positive query, then set-difference against
  the unfiltered db\" -- that would leak exactly this way. Rule bodies
  thread the same `visible?` through every clause they contain (triple,
  `not`, or nested rule invocation), so this guarantee holds recursively.

  **Safe negation**: every logic variable inside a `(not [e a v])` clause
  must already be bound by an earlier positive clause IN THE SAME `:where`
  OR rule body (checked statically, before any join or fixpoint runs) --
  `not` only ever narrows an existing binding, it can never itself
  introduce or enumerate a variable's values. `_` (wildcard) is exempt --
  it doesn't bind, so `(not [?x :flag _])` (\"no flag fact of any value\")
  is always safe. `(not (rule-name ...))` -- negating a RULE invocation,
  not a plain triple pattern -- is deliberately NOT supported: combining
  recursion and negation soundly requires stratification (a rule may
  never negate itself, even transitively), which this landing does not
  implement; throws a clear error instead of silently misbehaving.

  **Rules and fixpoint**: `:rules` groups multiple named definitions,
  each `[(rule-name ?param ...) clause ...]` -- a rule name may have
  several definitions (each an alternative/OR branch, e.g. a recursive
  rule's base case and inductive case are two definitions of the same
  name). A `:where` (or another rule body's) clause `(rule-name ?arg ...)`
  joins against that rule's CURRENT materialized tuple set exactly like a
  triple clause joins against `db` -- arg positions may be bound values,
  logic variables (bound or not yet bound), or `_`.

  Evaluated via semi-naive least-fixpoint iteration: seed round derives
  whatever every rule's non-recursive (base-case) definitions produce
  from `db` alone; each subsequent round re-evaluates every definition
  once per rule-invocation clause position within it, using that
  position's rule's DELTA (newly-derived-last-round tuples) and every
  other rule-invocation's FULL (all tuples derived so far) -- the
  standard semi-naive rewriting, chosen over naive re-evaluation from the
  start so this doesn't need a later rewrite once real datasets make
  naive's full-recompute-every-round cost matter. Guaranteed to terminate
  (derivation is monotonic -- tuples are only ever added -- over `db`'s
  finite domain); a defensive iteration cap throws if the fixpoint
  somehow fails to converge, rather than looping forever.

  ADR-2607061200 query-language follow-up (this landing): `:in` (extra
  positional query parameters beyond `db`/`visible?`), predicate/function
  `:where` clauses (`[(> ?age 18)]`, `[(str ?a ?b) ?c]`, a WHITELISTED
  function registry -- see `query-fns` -- not arbitrary code execution),
  and `or`/`or-join` (union across alternative derivations).

  **Execution strategies** (ADR-2608021000, ported from arrangement): a join
  step issues ONE scan per distinct substituted pattern rather than one per
  binding; with a caller-supplied `:clause-cardinality` hint it may instead
  read a small relation once and hash join it; and variables no remaining
  clause and no `:find` element reads are pruned between steps. Every one of
  these is a strategy and none is allowed to change an answer -- the ported
  test suites assert each against the path it replaces.

  **`:limit` is NOT pushed into the join.** An ordered drive -- walking the
  ordering clause's distinct values through the value-ordered index and
  stopping at `:limit` -- was landed upstream and then REVERTED there
  (`arrangement` a98588c), because it re-derives every remaining clause once
  per value group, including the clauses that do not depend on the driver at
  all. On LDBC IC02 that turned 882 rows into 6.5M of pure repetition to avoid
  joining 7,355, and the harness went from ~4-5 minutes of CPU to over 15.
  The equivalence tests all still passed: what broke was cost, and a small
  fixture has too few distinct values for the pathology to appear. The correct
  shape is a join reordering (evaluate driver-independent clauses once, run
  only the dependent ones per group, semi-join the two) and is not written
  yet. `:limit` therefore applies to the finished projection.

  **Known gaps, stated rather than implied** (see also the README):
  `not-join` (generalized negation over a multi-clause conjunction with
  explicit variable scoping, vs. today's single-triple `not`) is NOT
  implemented. `pull` does not exist -- projection is positional `:find`
  vectors only. Stratified negation is NOT implemented, which is why
  `(not (rule-name ...))` throws instead of guessing. There is no
  `:with`, no `:find` pull/collection/scalar shorthand (`?x .`, `[?x ...]`).
  There is no query PLANNER: `:where` clauses join strictly left-to-right in
  the order written, and `:clause-cardinality` is a hint a caller's own
  planner supplies, not one this library computes."

  - `(or clause1 clause2 ...)`: union of resolving EACH branch against
    the current bindings independently (an alternative/OR derivation,
    not a conjunction).
  - `(or-join [?shared...] clause1 clause2 ...)`: like `or`, but only

  optional arg, positional, same order as `:in`) supplies their values.
  `'$` in `:in` is accepted as a no-op placeholder for `db` itself
  (already passed separately); every other symbol consumes one value
  from `inputs`, pre-bound before `:where` runs.

  `:rules` (optional; omit or `[]` for plain Stage 1/2 queries, unchanged)
  is `[[(rule-name ?param ...) clause ...] ...]` -- see ns docstring for
  the fixpoint/semi-naive contract, safety, and the `visible?` guarantee
  extending recursively into rule bodies.

  `:order-by` / `:limit` (optional) make top-N expressible in the query
  instead of in host code. `:order-by` is a vector of `:find` elements,
  each optionally `[element :asc|:desc]` (default `:asc`); a key that is
  not in `:find` is an error, not a no-op. Supplying either key changes
  the return type from a SET to a VECTOR, because an ordered result is a
  sequence. `:limit` without `:order-by` returns an unspecified subset --
  useful for probes, not for top-N.

  `:clause-cardinality` (optional) is `{clause estimated-rows}` -- a
  planner's own per-clause row estimate, which it already computes in
  order to choose a clause order. When a clause's whole relation is small
  relative to the number of keyed scans a join step would issue for it,
  the executor reads that relation ONCE and hash-joins instead. Omit it
  and every step stays on the keyed path, which is the safe default: a
  broad scan of a large relation is the mistake the budget avoids, and a
  hint that is absent is not a hint that is wrong. It never changes an
  answer -- see `hash-join-rows` and the equivalence tests.

  These are applied to the finished projection: the join still does all
  of its work, so this makes top-N SAYABLE, not yet cheaper. Every LDBC
  SNB complex read is a \"most recent N\" query, and until this existed a
  caller had to materialize the whole join and sort it in host code
  (kotobase-peer bench/results/2026-08-01-ldbc-snb-interactive.edn did
  exactly that, and said so). Pushing the limit into the join is a
  separate change -- see `order+limit`."
