  "ADR-2608021000 §6-5 B-3: drop variables no remaining clause and no output
  needs, so bindings that differed only in a column nobody reads collapse.

  Every test asserts the SAME query returns the same answer as it did before,
  because pruning is only ever allowed to change how many intermediate rows
  exist -- never which rows come out. The one case where it is NOT allowed is
  aggregates, where multiplicity is the answer, and that has its own test."
