  "ADR-2608021000 §6-4-1: when a clause's whole relation is small relative to
  the number of keyed scans a step would issue for it, read it once and hash
  join.

  The property that matters is not that it is faster -- it is that it cannot
  change an answer. Every test here runs the SAME query twice, once with the
  planner's cardinality hint and once without, and asserts the two results are
  equal. That is the whole safety argument: the hint selects a strategy, never
  a semantics."
