  "ADR-2608021000 §6-5 B-2: a top-N query walks its ordering clause's distinct
  values in order and stops, instead of joining everything and sorting.

  Every test asserts the driven answer equals the undriven one. The ordered
  drive is a strategy; it is not allowed to be a different query. The way to
  make it undriven is to remove :limit -- that is exactly the condition
  `ordered-driver` keys on."
